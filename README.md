# HatchDragons

I created this app for practice. It's based on the mobile app "DragonVale" by Backflip Studios.

## Run locally

Download and install app:
```
git clone git@github.com:bananno/hatch-dragons.git
cd hatch-dragons
npm install
```

A mongodb instance must be running in a separate tab:
```
mongod
```

Start server:
```
npm start
```

Local address will open automatically:
```
http://localhost:6200/
```
